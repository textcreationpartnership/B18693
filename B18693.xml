            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of the Owners of the Ship <hi>Averilla,</hi> Burthen Three Hundred and Fifty Tons.</head>
            <p>THE said Ship was in <hi>September,</hi> 1694. permitted by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to go to <hi>Guinea,</hi> in the Service of the Royal <hi>African</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, Manned with Sixty Men, and Thirty Guns, and from thence intended to <hi>Barbadoes</hi> and <hi>Virginia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>June</hi> 1695. She Arrived at <hi>Barbadoes</hi> with her Freight of <hi>Negroes,</hi> having (by the Providence of God) not buried one Man, nor had one Man Sick during her Voyage to that Place.</p>
            <p>But immediately Upon her Arrival there, Captain <hi>Dawley</hi> Commander of His Majesties Ship the <hi>Bristol</hi> Prest Fifteen of his Seamen, and in Three Dayes after Captain <hi>Masum,</hi> Commander of a small Frigat Prest Six more; Upon which Nine more deserted the Ship for fear as is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd of the said Usage.</p>
            <p>There remained then on Board but Four Common Seamen, besides Seven Boys, and about Twenty Officers. And upon Consultation they thought it not safe to proceed to <hi>Virginia</hi> (being so disabled) but to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine their Outward-Bound Voyage at <hi>Barbadoes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Master there disposing of his <hi>Negroes,</hi> and Lading home from thence to <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But finding his Number of Men insufficient to Navigate his Ship and make any reasonable Defence in Case of an Attacque, Thought it adviseable to Redeem Four of his Men of the Captains that Prest them, at Five Pound <hi>per</hi> Man, and withal gave to the Captain of the <hi>Bristol</hi> Ten Pound to Convoy him Clear of the <hi>Leeward Islands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his Passage Home to <hi>England,</hi> in Company with Eleven Sail more, was Met with by Two <hi>French</hi> Privateers in <hi>Soundings,</hi> and after a Fight of Three Hours, in which the Captain and Six more were Killed, and Six or Seven Wounded, the said Ship and Four more were taken; to the Loss of the Interested in that single Ship above Twenty Five Thousand Pound.</p>
            <p>In all probability had he had his Compliment of Men he might have Escaped; the Two Privateers not exceeding him together in Number of Guns, But were incouraged to Assault him by his Insufficiency to Defend himself.</p>
            <p>This is the Third Ship that some of these Gentlemen have lost by Pressing their Men at Sea and in Foreign Parts.</p>
